<h2>Blood in the OR<H2>
    <h6> "Patient with severe abdominal and chest trauma, move! move!" I heard a paramedic saying as the dying patient was hurriedly willed into the emergency room, everyone moving helter-skelter, but definitely not in a confused state. A guy had been severely stabbed with a knife penetrating numbers of inches into his thoracic cavity. "He needs a rapid response, abnormally high pulse rate, shortness of breath, acute hemorrhages of about 2.0 liters â€œthe paramedic declared. 
        This happened during my night shift as a resident with just a single senior doctor around. The knife was still stuck in his left chest when he arrived at the hospital, I was definitely in as state of confusion, and for some reasons one thing I could remember was never to remove the knife without a proper assessment.
